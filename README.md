# Research-Anomaly-Detection-in-Spacecraft

Detecting anomalies in a safety-critical environment on spacecrafts. Considered ways to detect anomalies in multivariate time series using methods such as Out of Limits, Clutsering, Nearest Neighborhood, Expert Systems, and Deep Learning-based approaches such as Long Short Term Memory. I then investigated the use of LSTMs in detail because there are problems with data such as lack of labeled anomalies, noisy high-dimensional data, and context dependency.
